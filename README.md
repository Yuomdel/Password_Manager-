PASSWORD MANAGER

1.Introduction:
The purpose of my project, Password Manager, was to create a secure and convenient solution for individuals to manage their online passwords. As a solo developer, I took on the role of designing, developing, and testing the password manager over a period of three months. This project was created for individuals who struggle with password fatigue, weak passwords, and password reuse, with the goal of providing a user-friendly and secure platform to simplify their online lives.
My personal focus was on developing a robust and intuitive password manager that would appeal to a wide range of users. As someone who has personally struggled with password management, I was driven to create a solution that would make a tangible impact on people's online security.
